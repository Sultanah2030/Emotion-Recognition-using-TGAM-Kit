# Emotion-Recognition-using-TGAM-Kit
This project recognizes emotions (happiness and sadness) using EEG signals and machine learning. The main goal of this project is to classify emotions using a single-channel EEG device (TGAM). The project uses signal processing techniques to clean the data and machine learning (SVM classifier) to classify emotions.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used for training is based on EEG signals collected using the TGAM device. It contains two types of emotional states:
- Happy
  
- Sad

# Results
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of 88.64%.

- The happiness state was classified with 96% accuracy.

- The sadness state was classified with 84% accuracy.

- The results are based on a trade-off between the low-cost single-channel EEG device and classification performance.
